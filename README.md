# GitHubTemplates

This repo contains template files to add to your projects if you upload them to source code repositories.
Use these files to make your project easy to understand, especially when you have many people on your team or
you are planning to publish it on a public repo like GitHub.

---------------------------------------

See the [change log](CHANGELOG.md) for changes and road map.

## Folders

Each folder of the project (currently only one) contains a set of templates serving a different purpose.
- Basic - a set of sample templates for any project. The files are based on the [Extensibility Tools](https://visualstudiogallery.msdn.microsoft.com/ab39a092-1343-46e2-b0f1-6a3f91155aa6) extension for Visual Studio that [Mads Kristensen](https://visualstudiogallery.msdn.microsoft.com/site/search?f%5B0%5D.Type=User&f%5B0%5D.Value=Mads%20Kristensen) created.

Also, check out the huge .gitignore example repo for many languages [here](https://github.com/github/gitignore).
