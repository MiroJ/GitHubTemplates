## Folders

Each folder of the project (currently only one) contains a set of templates serving a different purpose.
- **Basic set** - a set of sample templates for any project. The files are based on the [Extensibility Tools](https://visualstudiogallery.msdn.microsoft.com/ab39a092-1343-46e2-b0f1-6a3f91155aa6) extension for Visual Studio that [Mads Kristensen](https://visualstudiogallery.msdn.microsoft.com/site/search?f%5B0%5D.Type=User&f%5B0%5D.Value=Mads%20Kristensen) created.
- **License samples** - a set of sample license files covering some common cases. Choose and add only one to your project.

Also, check out the huge .gitignore example repo for many languages [here](https://github.com/github/gitignore).
